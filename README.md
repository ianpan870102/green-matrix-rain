# green-matrix-rain
A recreating/simulation of the digital rain scene from The Matrix (movie)

*Inspired by "The Matrix" and "TheCodingTrain".*

The programme consists of two simple files: an `index.html` and a `sketch.js`
The easiest way to view the simulation is to simply open the index.html file in your preferred browser.

**Below is a preview (GIF), you can use Chrome, Safari or whichever browser you prefer:**
